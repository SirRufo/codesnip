## Overview

CodeSnip is an open source code bank for storing and viewing your code snippets. While it can manage snippets in any source language, it is focussed mainly on Pascal and Delphi code for which additional features are available.

CodeSnip can import code from the DelphiDabbler [Code Snippets Database](https://github.com/delphidabbler/code-snippets).

The program is available in both standard and portable editions.

CodeSnip requires Windows 2000 or later and Internet Explorer 6 or later, although XP and IE 8 and later are preferred.

## Installation

CodeSnip is installed and removed using a standard Windows installer. Administrator privileges are required for installation.

## Support

The following support is available for CodeSnip:

* A comprehensive help file.
* A [read-me file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delphidabbler/codesnip/master/Docs/ReadMe.txt)<sup> *</sup> that discusses installation, configuration, updating and known issues.
* An [FAQ](https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip-faq/blob/master/UsingCodeSnip.md)
* A [Blog](http://codesnip-app.blogspot.co.uk/).
* A [privacy statement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/delphidabbler/codesnip/master/Docs/Privacy.txt)<sup>*</sup> that provides information about any personal information stored by the program and what info is transmitted over the net.

There's also plenty of info available on how to compile CodeSnip from source - see below.

## Source Code

Up to and including release 4.13.1 the project's source code was maintained in a Subversion repository on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/p/codesnip/code/). The Subversion repo was converted to Git in October 2015 and imported to GitHub. All releases from v3.0.0 are marked by tags in the form `version-x.x.x` where `x.x.x` is the version number.

> Note that any branches that were created and deleted in the Subversion repo are missing from the Git history. So, for full details of the the project's history from v3.0.0 to v4.13.1 please refer to the old Subversion repo on SourceForge.

Following tag `version-4.13.1` the [Git Flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) methodology was adopted. The exception is the `pagoda` branch that sits outside Git Flow. This branch was originally planned to be the CodeSnip v5 development branch (see [below](#codesnip-5-development) for details).

Up to and including release 4.13.1, `master` is simply a copy of the old Subversion `trunk` and, as such, contains various development commits along with numerous commits related to management of Subversion. After release 4.13.1, and the addition of this read-me file, `master` contains only commits relating to an actual release.

### Contributions

To contribute to the project please fork the repository on GitHub. Create a feature branch off the development branch. Make your changes to that branch then submit a pull request on GitHub.

### Compiling

`master` and each branch will have a file in the root directory named `Build.html` that gives detailed information about how to compile CodeSnip.

There is also an [FAQ](https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip-faq) -- (see [Support](#support) above).

## Change Log

The program's current change log can be found in the file `Docs/ChangeLogs/ChangeLog-v4.txt` on the `master` branch. Change logs for other major releases are in the same directory.

## License

The program's EULA, which gives full details of the license applying to the latest release, can be found in the file `Docs\License.html` in the `master` branch. The license has changed between releases, so if you need to see an older one, select the appropriate `version-x.x.x` tag and read the older version of the file.

Most of the original code is made available under the [Mozilla Public License v2](https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).

The [CodeSnip Compiling & Source Code FAQ](https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip-faq/blob/master/SourceCode.md) may be useful if you have any queries about re-using CodeSnip source in other projects.

## Bug Reports and Features

You can report bugs or request new features using the [Issues section](https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip/issues) of the CodeSnip GitHub project. You will need a GitHub account to do this.

Please do not report bugs unless you have checked whether the bug exists in the latest version of the program.
