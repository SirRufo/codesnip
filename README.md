# CodeSnip Pagoda

> **Branch abandoned**
> 
> The `pagoda` branch, which had been moribund since July 2014, was officially abandoned in January 2020.
> 
> The branch will remain in the repository for the time being in case some of its code can be salvaged for use in a later version of CodeSnip.
> 
> Anyone is welcome to take over development of this branch. If you do, please fork the repository. But _do not_ submit any changes back here. On the other hand pull requests for the main CodeSnip v4 code base are welcome. **Warning: `pagoda` contains code that accesses web services that are no longer available.**

## About `pagoda`

The `pagoda` branch is a continuation of the earlier `parsnip` branch. Together the branches represent a 1st, albeit abortive, attempt at developing CodeSnip v5 from the CodeSnip v4 code base.

The original idea behind v5 was to:

1. Generalise CodeSnip to be a code bank for several different languages instead of just Pascal, while still providing some additional support for test-compiling Pascal code.
2. Increase the focus on the user's own code while downplaying the importance of code downloaded from the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets database,

## History of the `pagoda` branch

The `pagoda` branch was branched from the earlier `parsnip` branch.

`parsnip` was begun on 2013-08-18 by branching from the CodeSnip v4 code base in the old Subversion repository `trunk`, just after the release of CodeSnip 4.7.1.

After hundreds of commits development of `parsnip` faltered, with the last significant work being committed on 2014-10-29. Subsequent commits were simply merges of updates from the CodeSnip 4 code tree, with the last being made on 2015-09-30, following the release of CodeSnip v4.13.1.

`pagoda` was branched from `parsnip` on 2015-09-30, the day after `parsnip`'s last commit. This branch was begun in the Subversion repository, but there was only one commit before the whole of the CodeSnip code base was imported into Git and moved to GitHub on 2015-10-07. The `parsnip` branch had been removed by 2016-02-21.

Work on `pagoda` began in February 2014 and continued through March 2014 when, apart from a few commits in July 2014, the branch was effectively abandoned.

To all intents and purposes `pagoda` was just a continuation of `parsnip`. The reason for the name change is lost in the mists of time!

## Life after `pagoda`?

On 2020/01/24 a new branch, `pavilion`, was branched from `pagoda`. But that's another story. See the `pavilion` branch read-me for details.
