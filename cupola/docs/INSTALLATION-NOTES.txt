How to Install CodeSnip LE Cupola
=================================

**WARNING**: This is pre-release software. There are likely to be bugs. Please
make sure you have a backup of your snippets files before using this program.

Installation
------------

There is no installer supplied with this version of CodeSnip LE Cupola.
Installation is done manually. It is a very simple process. Proceed as follows:

1.  Unzip the .zip file you downloaded.

2.  You will find two executable files. CodeSnip.Cupola.exe is a 64 bit
    executable while CodeSnip.Cupola32.exe is 32 bit. Use CodeSnip.Cupola.exe
    unless you are running a 32 bit version of Windows, in which case you need
    CodeSnip.Cupola32.exe.
    
    **Note:** the 64 bit version is the primary one and receives more testing.

3.  Create a folder somewhere on your computer's disk drive or on a writeable
    removable drive.
    
    **Warning:** Do not install inside either the %ProgramFiles% or 
    %ProgramFiles(x86)% folder.

4.  Copy either CodeSnip.Cupola.exe or CodeSnip.Cupola32.exe to the chosen
    folder.

5.  Run the program by double clicking it.

6.  Optionally create a shortcut to the .exe file by right clicking and dragging
    the .exe file to your desktop then selecting "Create shortcuts here" from
    the popup menu.

Note that CodeSnip LE Cupola will create sub-directories in the folder where you
installed it. Do not delete or rename those directories unless you are
uninstalling the program or you may loose data.

Updating
--------

If you are updating an existing installation of CodeSnip LE Cupola to a new
version then you must overwrite the existing .exe file in the folder where you
originally installed it. Be careful not to overwrite or delete any sub-folders
that the previous verison of the program created or you may loose data.

Uninstalling
------------

Simply delete the .exe file from the folder you originally installed it to. If
you are sure you won't be needing your snippets again then you can safely delete
the folder where you installed the program, along with any subfolders.

**Warning**: If you want to keep your snippet data then do not delete the
folder or its sub-folders.

Moving an installation
----------------------

You can easily move the CodeSnip LE Cupola installation to another folder.
Simply create the required folder then move the executable file along with any
sub-folders into the new folder. You can then delete the old folder.
