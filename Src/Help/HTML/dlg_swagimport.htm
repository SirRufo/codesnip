      SWAG Import Wizard
    </h1>
    <p>
      This wizard is used to enable you to import snippets from the
      <a href="about_swag.htm">SWAG Database</a> into your code snippets
      database. The wizard is accessed from the <em>Snippets | Import
      Snippets From SWAG</em> menu option.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 1: <em>Import snippets from SWAG</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page gives an overview of how to use the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard requires that you have a suitable copy of SWAG stored on your
      computer. If you haven't yet got it then you need to download it before
      continuing. The instructions shown in the box on this page of the wizard
      explain how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready, click the <em>Next</em> button.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 2: <em>Select SWAG database download folder</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      On this page you need to provide the full path to the folder where you
      downloaded the SWAG database. Enter the path in the edit box. You can
      click the ellipsis button to the right of the edit box to display a
      standard browse for folder dialogue box and choose the folder from there.
      The chosen folder will be entered into the edit box for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have entered the path click <em>Next</em>. The data in the folder
      will then be read and, if valid, the next page of the wizard will be
      displayed. A progress bar may be displayed if the process of reading the
      data takes some time. If the data is invalid an error message will be
      displayed and the page will not change.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 3: <em>Select required snippets</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      When this page is first displayed it displays all the categories of
      snippets available in the SWAG database in the <em>SWAG categories</em>
      list box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Choose a category in the list and click the <em>Show Snippets In
      Category</em> button to display a list of its snippets in the right
      hand list box. Alternatively just double-click the category name. The
      first time you choose a category the wizard will read the list of snippets
      from the database and a progress bar may be displayed while this is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Select any snippets you want to import by ticking the check box next to
      the snippet's name. If you want to preview the snippet before deciding
      whether to import it, highlight the snippet and click the <em>Preview
      Selected Snippet</em> button. Alternatively just double click the snippet
      name. The snippet will then be read from the database (if necessary) and
      displayed in a dialogue box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeat this process for further categories if you wish. When you are
      ready to import your chosen snippets click the <em>Next</em> button to
      display the next page. Note that you must select at least one snippet in
      order to move on.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> Do not select too many snippets
      to be imported at one time because the import process is not very
      efficient and can take a long time.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 4: <em>Ready to import</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page lists all the snippets you have selected for import along with
      the unique ID (i.e. snippet name) that will be assigned to it after
      import. Note that some snippets may need to be retrieved from the SWAG
      database when the page is displayed and a progress bar may be displayed
      while this happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should review your selection. If you want to make any changes use the
      <em>Back</em> button to go back to the previous page and de-select any
      unwanted snippets or select any snippets you may have missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you are ready to proceed, click the <em>Import</em> button. Once
      <em>Import</em> has been clicked the wizard will perform the import
      &ndash; there is no going back. A dialogue box will be displayed while the
      import proceeds. When the import has finished the final page of the wizard
      will be displayed.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Page 5: <em>Import complete</em>
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page simply confirms the import has completed. You should note that
      all the snippets will have been imported into the same special category,
      the name of which will be displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Click the <em>Finish</em> button to close the wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The imported snippets are fully editable like any other user defined
      snippet.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> <em>CodeSnip</em> does not track snippets imported
      from SWAG, so if you import the same snippet more than once it will be
      duplicated in your local database &ndash; it will not overwrite the
      original. You will not be warned about such duplications.
