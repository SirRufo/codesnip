      About The SWAG Database
    </h1>
    <p>
      SWAG is a collection of source code and program examples for the Pascal
      programming language that was maintained up to the end of 1997. Each chunk
			of source code or example is known as a <em>packet</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the SWAG database is old, it is extensive and some of the code is
      still relevant for today's programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> provides the
      <a href="dlg_swagimport.htm">SWAG Import Wizard</a> that enables you to
      browse a local copy of the SWAG database and convert any of its packets
      into snippets that can be imported into your local snippets database
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download the database from the <a
        href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/swag"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      ><code>delphidabbler/swag</code></a> project on GitHub. Go to the
			<em>releases</em> tab and download the latest supported version&dagger;.
			Unpack the zip file into an empty folder then run the SWAG Import Wizard
			and navigate to the <code>swag</code> sub-directory of the folder where
			you extracted the zip file . The wizard reads the database and guides you
			through the import process.
    </p>
		<p>
			&dagger; The first page of the SWAG Import Wizard specifies which versions
      of SWAG are supported by CodeSnip.
