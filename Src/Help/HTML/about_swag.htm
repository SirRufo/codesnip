      About The SWAG Database
    </h1>
    <p>
      SWAG is a collection of source code and program examples for the Pascal
      programming language that was maintained up to the end of 1997.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the SWAG database is old it is extensive and some of the code is
      still relevant for today's programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> provides the
      <a href="dlg_swagimport.htm">SWAG Import Wizard</a> that enables you to
      browse a local copy of the SWAG database and import any of its snippets
      into your snippets database.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can download the database from the <a
        href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/swag"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      ><code>delphidabbler/swag</code></a> project on GitHub. Go to the <em>releases</em> tab and download the latest version. Unpack the zip file into an empty folder then run the SWAG Import Wizard and navigate to the folder where you extracted the zip file contents.
