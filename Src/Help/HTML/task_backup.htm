      Backup and Restore the User Database
    </h1>
    <p>
      To protect against unexpected errors like hard disk failure it is wise to
      periodically backup your user database. <em>CodeSnip</em> has a tool to
      help with this: it can write your complete user database to a single file
      that you can archive safely. <em>CodeSnip</em> can recreate the user
      database from such backup files if necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="bordered">
      Note that backups <strong>do not</strong> include the main DelphiDabbler
      Snippets Database. This is because you can just download a fresh copy of
      it from the internet if you need to replace it. Use the <em>Database |
      Install or Update DelphiDabbler Snippets Database</em> menu option to do
      that.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How to create a backup
    </h2>
    <p>
      To perform the backup just select the <em>Database | Backup User
      Database</em> menu option. This displays a
      <a href="dlg_backup.htm">file dialogue box</a> where you specify a file to
      use for the backup. It is up to you how to name the file. Including the
      date of the backup may be a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can save the file to a USB drive or portable hard drive or put it
      something like a Dropbox or Google Drive folder.
    </p>
    <h2>
      How to restore a backup
    </h2>
    <p>
      Should the worst happen and you loose your user defined database you can
      recreate it from your latest backup.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this use the <em>Database | Restore Backup</em> menu option. This
      displays a <a href="dlg_restore.htm">file dialogue box</a> where you can
      navigate to your chosen backup file. Select the file and click <em>OK</em>
      to restore the backup.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the backup file is valid it will replace any existing user database and
      then the whole database will be reloaded. All existing tabs in the user
      interface will be closed. When the database has finished reloading a
      new tab will open with a message informing that the database has been
      updated.
