      Install or Update the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Database
    </h1>
    <p>
      You can install the DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Database into
      <em>CodeSnip</em> as follows.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the latest release of the database from the
        <code>delphidabbler/code-snippets</code> project on GitHub. You can find
        the latest release at
        <a
          href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/code-snippets/releases"
          class="weblink"
        >https://github.com/delphidabbler/code-snippets/releases</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unpack the downloaded zip file into a <strong>new or empty</strong>
        folder on your computer. The folder <strong>must not</strong> be a sub
        folder of <em>CodeSnip</em>'s application or user database directories.
      </li>
      <li>
        Display the <a
         href="dlg_update.htm"
        >Install or Update DelphiDabbler Snippets Database</a> wizard from the
        <em>Database | Install or Update DelphiDabbler Snippets
        Database</em> menu option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Skip the first page of the wizard by clicking <em>Next</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the <em>Select database download folder</em> page of the wizard enter
        the full path of the folder where you unpacked the downloaded zip file.
        Click <em>Next</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <em>Install the database</em> page will now be displayed. Click
        <em>Load</em> to load the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the database has been copied the <em>Database installed</em> page
        will be displayed and you can close the wizard using the <em>Finish</em>
        button.
      </li>
      <li>
        The database is now installed. You can now delete both the downloaded
        zip file and the folder where you unpacked it.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You can periodically check the <code>delphidabbler/code-snippets</code>
      GitHub account to see if any new releases have been made. To update to the
      latest release simply repeat the process above.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Notes
    </h2>
    <p>
      A single copy of DelphiDabbler Code Snippets Database is shared by all
      users of the same computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Updating the database has no effect on any user-defined snippets that have
      been created &ndash; they are not overwritten by the update process.
      However, it does no harm to take a backup of your snippets before
      performing the update! Use the <em>Database | Backup User Database</em>
      menu option to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot edit snippets from the Code Snippets Database. You can identify
      them easily because, by default, the snippet name is displayed in a
      different colour to user-defined snippets.
