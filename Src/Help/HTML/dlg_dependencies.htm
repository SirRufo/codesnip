    <h1>
      Dependencies Dialogue Box
    </h1>
    <p>
      This dialogue box is displayed by choosing the <em>View |
      Dependencies</em> menu item or by pressing
      <span class="smallcaps">Ctrl+D</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Tabs
    </h2>
    <p>
      The dialogue box has two tabs: <em>Depends Upon</em> and <em>Required
      By</em>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <em>Depends Upon</em> Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the selected snippet has dependencies (i.e. snippets it depends upon in
      order to compile) a tree of snippets is displayed that shows the direct
      and indirect dependencies. When there are no dependencies a message is
      displayed to that effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a circular reference is detected (i.e. the snippet depends directly or
      indirectly upon itself) the circular reference is displayed in red and an
      error message is displayed. Such a dependency indicates there is an error
      in the database.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <em>Required By</em> Tab
    </h3>
    <p>
      This tab displays a simple list of snippets that immediately depend on the
      selected snippet. Again, if there are no snippets to list, a message is
      displayed to that effect.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <em>Select &amp; Close</em> button
    </h2>
    <p>
      This button appears to the left of the <em>Close</em> and <em>Help</em>
      buttons. It's purpose is to select the snippets listed on the currently
      active tab and to display that selection when the dialogue box is closed.
      If the active tab lists no snippets then the button is disabled.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong class="warning">Warning:</strong> Any selection made using this
      button will replace any search results that were previously displayed. No
      warning will be displayed.
    </p>
