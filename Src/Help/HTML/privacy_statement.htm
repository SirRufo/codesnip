    <h2>
      Offline Privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> stores some personal information in two configuration
      files. The location of the files differs depending on whether you are
      using the standard or portable edition.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code style="text-decoration:underline;">Common.config</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>Common.config</code> is located in the in the
      <code>%ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4</code> folder for the
      standard edition or in the <code>AppData</code> sub folder of the install
      directory for the portable edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data that is stored in <code>Common.config</code> includes a unique 32 digit hexadecimal key based on attributes of your computer. The data that is used to create the hexadecimal key cannot be recovered from the key.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code style="text-decoration:underline;">User.config</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>User.config</code> is found in the current user's
      <code>%AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4</code> folder for the standard
      edition or in the <code>AppData</code> sub folder of the install directory
      for the portable edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file stores several user-specific application data
      settings such as your preferences. The only personal information is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any user name or email address you provided if you ever entered the
        information in a dialogue box. This is used simply to automatically
        enter the data in dialogue boxes where needed, to save you re-typing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your user name and password if you configured <em>CodeSnip</em> to
        access the internet using a proxy server. The information is used only
        to access the proxy. Passwords are encrypted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Spyware
    </h2>
    <p>
      No spyware or other software that threatens your privacy has been
      deliberately or knowingly included with <em>CodeSnip</em> or its
      installer. If the program is found to contain spyware it will have been
      added by third parties without permission. Please inform the author of any
      such occurrence or any suspicious behaviour via <a
        href="http://delphidabbler.com/contact"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >http://delphidabbler.com/contact</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> never tries to &quot;phone home&quot; of its own
      accord. It only goes online in response to user requests. Should you
      notice any unauthorised activity please inform the author since it is
      likely that your copy of the program has been hacked by some third party.
    </p>
    <h2>
      CodeSnip Online Activity
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> may go online for several reasons. They are:
    </p>
    <ol class="unspaced">
      <li>
        Updating the database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Importing snippets from the SWAG database.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessing various websites via hyperlinks and menu options.
      </li>
      <li>
        Accessing the internet using a proxy server.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The first two actions are performed directly by <em>CodeSnip</em>,
      which communicates with web services located on delphidabbler.com
      using HTTP on port 80. The third action simply displays web pages in a
      browser. The fourth passes user information to the proxy server.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal data will neither be published on the DelphiDabbler website nor
      knowingly passed to third parties. Furthermore your data will only be
      used by the author for the purposes described below.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Updating the Database
    </h3>
    <p>
      This activity is started by displaying the &quot;Update From Web&quot;
      dialogue box and clicking its &quot;Update from Web&quot; button.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> may also check automatically, behind the scenes, to see
      if database updates are available. This usually happens just after the
      program has started. You can disable this automatic checking by using the
      &quot;Updates&quot; tab of the &quot;Preferences&quot; dialogue box which
      is displayed via the &quot;Tools | Preferences&quot; menu option.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <em>CodeSnip</em> contacts the update web service it sends the
      following information:
    </p>
    <ul class="unspaced">
      <li>
        The unique 32 digit program key (see Common.config above for details).
      </li>
      <li>
        Program version number.
      </li>
      <li>
        Operating system description.
      </li>
      <li>
        Internet Explorer version.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is recorded in two places:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Each transaction is recorded in a log file on the web server. This log
        is used for tracking any database errors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <div>
          A database of the program keys is updated with the following data:
        </div>
        <ul class="unspaced">
          <li>
            the number of times that program has updated the database;
          </li>
          <li>
            the first and latest version of CodeSnip having that program key;
          </li>
          <li>
            the date of the first and latest updates;
          </li>
          <li>
            the current operating system being used;
          </li>
          <li>
            the current Internet Explorer version being used.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          This database is used to provide usage information and to track the
          operating systems and browser control versions currently in use. This
          information informs development of CodeSnip.
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      None of these records store any information that can be tracked back to an
      individual.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Importing snippets from the SWAG database
    </h3>
    <p>
      Snippets are imported from the SWAG database (<a
        href="http://swag.delphidabbler.com/"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >http://swag.delphidabbler.com</a>) using the <em>SWAG Import Wizard</em>
      that is accessed from the <em>Snippets | Import Snippets From SWAG</em>
      menu item.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wizard gets the required snippets from the REST API at
      swag.delphidabbler.com. This API is documented at <a
        href="http://swag.delphidabbler.com/docs/api/"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >http://swag.delphidabbler.com/docs/api/</a>. No personal data is sent.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessing Websites via Links and Menu Options
    </h3>
    <p>
      CodeSnip's <em>Help</em> menu contains several items that cause various
      web pages from DelphiDabbler.com to be displayed in your default web
      browser.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, various links in the program's main display, some dialogue
      boxes and the help file access remote websites which are displayed in your
      default browser. You should refer to the relevant website's privacy
      policies to learn how they use any data you supply when visiting their
      pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      DelphiDabbler has no control over the content of linked third party
      websites and you follow such links at your own risk.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessing the internet using a proxy server
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can be configured to use a proxy server to access the
      internet. In this case the program sends the appropriate user name and
      password to the proxy server if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      DelphiDabbler has no control over the proxy server and you should satisfy
      yourself that the proxy you use is trustworthy. You use this feature at
      your own risk.
