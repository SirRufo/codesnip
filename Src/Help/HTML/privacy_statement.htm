      Offline Privacy

    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> stores some personal information in two configuration
      files. The location of the files differs depending on whether you are
      using the standard or portable edition.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code style="text-decoration:underline;">Common.config</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>Common.config</code> is located in the in the
      <code>%ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4</code> folder for the
      standard edition. It is not used by the portable edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only version information is stored in <code>Common.config</code>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code style="text-decoration:underline;">User.config</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>User.config</code> is found in the current user's
      <code>%AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4</code> folder for the standard
      edition or in the <code>AppData</code> sub folder of the install directory
      for the portable edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file stores several user-specific application data settings such as
      your preferences. None of this information is personally identifiable.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Spyware
    </h2>
    <p>
      No spyware or other software that threatens your privacy has been
      deliberately or knowingly included with <em>CodeSnip</em> or its
      installer. If the program is found to contain spyware it will have been
      added by third parties without permission. Please inform the author of any
      such occurrence or any suspicious behaviour by creating an issue on <a
        href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >the CodeSnip GitHub repository</a> (GitHub account required).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> never tries to &quot;phone home&quot; of its own
      accord. It only goes online in response to user requests. Should you
      notice any unauthorised activity please inform the author since it is
      likely that your copy of the program has been hacked by some third party.
    </p>
    <h2>

    <p>
      CodeSnip's <em>Help</em> menu and several other parts of the user
      interface contain menu items and links that cause various third party web
      pages to be displayed in your default web browser. The author takes no
      responsibility for any data collected by your web browser or the
