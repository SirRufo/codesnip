      Offline Privacy
    </h2>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> stores some personal information in two configuration
      files. The location of the files differs depending on whether you are
      using the standard or portable edition.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code style="text-decoration:underline;">Common.config</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>Common.config</code> is located in the in the
      <code>%ProgramData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4</code> folder for the
      standard edition or in the <code>AppData</code> sub folder of the install
      directory for the portable edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data that is stored in <code>Common.config</code> includes a unique 32 digit hexadecimal key based on attributes of your computer. The data that is used to create the hexadecimal key cannot be recovered from the key.
    </p>
    <h3>
      <code style="text-decoration:underline;">User.config</code>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <code>User.config</code> is found in the current user's
      <code>%AppData%\DelphiDabbler\CodeSnip.4</code> folder for the standard
      edition or in the <code>AppData</code> sub folder of the install directory
      for the portable edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The file stores several user-specific application data
      settings such as your preferences. The only personal information is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any user name or email address you provided if you ever entered the
        information in a dialogue box. This is used simply to automatically
        enter the data in dialogue boxes where needed, to save you re-typing it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your user name and password if you configured <em>CodeSnip</em> to
        access the internet using a proxy server. The information is used only
        to access the proxy. Passwords are encrypted.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Spyware
    </h2>
    <p>
      No spyware or other software that threatens your privacy has been
      deliberately or knowingly included with <em>CodeSnip</em> or its
      installer. If the program is found to contain spyware it will have been
      added by third parties without permission. Please inform the author of any
      such occurrence or any suspicious behaviour by creating an issue on <a
        href="https://github.com/delphidabbler/codesnip"
        class="weblink"
        target="_blank"
      >the CodeSnip GitHub repository</a> (GitHub account required).
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> never tries to &quot;phone home&quot; of its own
      accord. It only goes online in response to user requests. Should you
      notice any unauthorised activity please inform the author since it is
      likely that your copy of the program has been hacked by some third party.
    </p>
    <h2>
      CodeSnip Online Activity
    </h2>
    <p>
      CodeSnip's <em>Help</em> menu and several other parts of the user
      interface contain menu items and links that cause various third party web
      pages to be displayed in your default web browser. The author takes no
      responsibility for any data collected by your web browser or the
      individual web sites.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Accessing the internet using a proxy server
    </h3>
    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> can be configured to use a proxy server to access the
      internet. In this case the program sends the appropriate user name and
      password to the proxy server if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      DelphiDabbler has no control over the proxy server and you should satisfy
      yourself that the proxy you use is trustworthy. You use this feature at
      your own risk.
