      <strong class="warning">This action cannot be undone. You will loose all the snippets in the collection. The collection itself will remain but will be empty.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Before going any further you are <strong>strongly advised</strong> to take a backup of the collection you are planning to delete. Use the <em>Database | Backup Collection Data</em> menu option to do this.
    </p>

    <p>
      To proceed, first choose the collection you want to delete from the <em>Choose collection</em> drop down list. Then confirm the action by entering <code>DELETE</code> <code>MY</code> <code>SNIPPETS</code> (in capital letters) in the <em>Confirm deletion</em> edit box.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>When you click <em>OK</em> there will be no further chances to change your mind.</strong>
