      This wizard enables you to import snippets from the <a
        class="help-link"
        href="help:AboutSWAG"
      >SWAG database</a> into your local user database.
    </p>

    <p class="framed">
      You must have a copy of a specially prepared version of SWAG on your local system before continuing. If you haven't already got it then you need to download it from the <em>delphidabbler/swag</em> repository on GitHub. Go to <a
        class="external-link"
        href="<%SWAGReleaseURL%>"
      ><%SWAGReleaseURL%></a> and find the latest release of the XML version of SWAG. The file name will be in the form <code>swag-xml-vX.X.X</code> where <code>X.X.X</code> is the version number. Download the file and unzip it into a folder on your computer. Make a note of the folder's location - it will be needed in the next step.

    <p>
      On the next page of the wizard you will be asked for the location of the folder containing the SWAG database. <em>CodeSnip</em> will then open the database and display all SWAG's categories on the following page. From there you can browse and display the snippets in each category before selecting those you want to import. You get a chance to review these before importing.
    </p>

    <p>
      All snippets are imported as <a
        class="help-link"
        href="help:SnippetFreeform"
      >freeform</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>CodeSnip</em> does not keep a track of snippets imported from SWAG &ndash; it treats them just like any other user defined snippet. This means it is possible to import the same snippet more than once. It's up to you to keep track of this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> It can take quite some time to import snippets from SWAG. You are advised not to import more than about 20 snippets in one go. If you want to import a lot of snippets you should run this wizard more than once.
